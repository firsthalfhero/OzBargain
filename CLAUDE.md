# Claude Code Configuration

## Pre-commit Requirements
Before completing any task or committing changes, always run:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If pre-commit fixes any files, re-run the command until it passes completely.

## Development Workflow
1. Complete the requested task
2. Run pre-commit checks and fix any issues
3. Only then mark the task as completed
4. Commit changes only if explicitly requested by the user
